           Fibrus Limited 

           Group strategic report 
           For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           Introduction 

           The directors have pleasure in presenting the strategic report for the year ended 31 March 2025. 

           Principal activity and strategy 

           Fibrus' principal activity is the deployment of new full fibre broadband infrastructure to homes and businesses 
           across Northern Ireland and parts of the North of England. 

           Our strategy is to deploy our full fibre infrastructure to regional and rural areas that have been underserved by 
           legacy networks. Fibrus has focused on regional towns and villages with lower fibre coverage. In addition, in both 
           Northern Ireland and Cumbria, Fibrus has won government funding to partly finance the deployment of network to 
           rural premises which would not otherwise be commercially viable, enabling our network to reach deeper into rural 
           areas. 

           We anticipate that the majority of homes and businesses in the areas that we operate will eventually have access to 
           other fibre networks in the future, so we focus on being first to get to market and proactively acquire the customers 
           based on better value and better service. 

           Operating review 

           Fibrus has established itself as one of the leading independent full fibre operators in the UK and Ireland due to a 
           track record of delivering on build and on customer take-up. 

           Build programme delivery 
           In March 2025 we delivered the second milestone of our BDUK funded Gigabit project in Cumbria, successfully 
           full fibre connectivity to almost 12,500 homes and businesses in Cumbria - on time and within budget. This was 
           part of a £108 million contract which initially covered 32,000 homes and businesses in Cumbria. 

           Partly as a result of this track record, our UK Government contract was been extended in March 2025, allowing the 
           company to deliver Full Fibre broadband to an additional 21,000 previously underserved premises in Cumbria with 
           the total subsidy increasing to £150 million. Once completed, alongside other commercial expansion plans, 99% of 
           homes and businesses in Cumbria will have access to next-generation broadband. 

           In June 2025 we completed the delivery of the 'Stratum' programme which brought full fibre connectivity to 81,148 
           homes across Northern Ireland. This large scale public infrastructure project was delivered on time and on budget 
           and has transformed access high speed connectivity in rural areas and delivered significant economic benefits to the 
           local economy. 

           An independently produced Economic Impact Report assessed that the project had delivered benefits of some £431 
           million to the local economy since 2020: 

           ·   £431 million in total economic value generated since 2020 
           ·   £74 million from company operations including turnover, wages, and job creation 
           ·   £271 million through supply chain investment 
           ·   £86 million from indirect spending by Fibrus employees across the local economy 
           ·   435 people employed by Fibrus 
           ·   £50.6 million in potential annual productivity gains per year from full fibre broadband access 
           ·   Over {411K charitable contributions across Northern Ireland 

           Northern Ireland now boasts 94% connectivity, outpacing other UK nations and regions. As a result, the region has 
           become a trailblazer in digital connectivity, helping to futureproof its workforce by enabling access to remote and 
           hybrid job opportunities across the UK and beyond. 
                                                                                                                  Page 1

           Fibrus Limited 

           Group strategic report (continued) 
           For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           Rapid customer take-up 
           Fibrus has delivered accelerated take-up across its footprint through its focus on product performance, best value 
           pricing and customer service. 

           Connected customers grew by 35k during the year, a growth of 45%, bringing our penetration rate to 27.9% of our 
           ready for service homes. 

           This growth has been achieved through a continued strong sales performance and our continued low rates of 
           customer churn, which is 5.4% on an annualised basis. Over half of this churn is categorised as uncontrollable for 
           reasons such as home moves off our network footprint and bad debt ceases. 

                                                                      Mar 22        Mar 23         Mar 24        Mar 25

           Principal risks and uncertainties 

           The management of the business and the execution of the Group and Company's strategy are subject to a number 
           of risks and uncertainties. The key risks and uncertainties affecting the Group and Company are considered to relate 
           to competition with other broadband providers, customer take-up, churn and technological advance. The key risks, 
           and the activities in place to manage such risks, are monitored on a regular basis. 

           Economic risk 
           The Group has interest bearing liabilities with credit institutions and investors, and therefore movement in interest 
           rates or inflation may impact these liabilities. Interest is accounted for through the Consolidated statement of 
           comprehensive income. 

           Competition risk 
           The directors of the Group and Company manage competition risk through close attention to customer service 
           levels and providing an effective service. 

           Financial risk 
           All key financial figures are monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group continues to have access to funding from 
           investors to continue its investment in the roll out of its network. 

           Credit risk 
           The Group is exposed to its customers defaulting on the payment of their debts. The Group mitigates this risk 
           through taking deposits on orders and practices robust credit control in collecting this debt. 

           Liquidity risk 
           The Group has obtained financing from its investors and lenders in order to meet its funding requirements. This 
           mitigates the risk to the Group. 

           Interest rate risk 
           The Group has interest bearing liabilities. Interest bearing liabilities relate to bank loans, which pay interest at 
           variable rates. The Group actively manages its interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps to help mitigate 
           interest rate rises. 

                                                                                                                    Page 2

          Fibrus Limited 

          Group strategic report (continued) 
          For the year ended 31 March 2025 

          Financial review 

          The year ended March 2025 saw revenues increase by £11.9m (67%) to £29.5m, this resulted in gross margin 
         increasing to £16.7m (2024: {6.2m). 

          Operating expenses, excluding depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items, reduced by £2.5m, which resulted 
         in a EBITDA profit for the year to £1.5m (2024: loss £11.7m). EBITDA has improved during the course of the 
         year on increasing revenues and we reported positive monthly EBITDA in March 2025 for the first time. 

          The net loss for the year was £57.6m which includes depreciation on capital expenditure of £34.1m, amortisation of 
          {1.6m and net interest charges of £23.4m. 

          We continued to invest heavily in building our network and connecting our customer base and during the year 
          invested £107.9m in capital expenditure. 

          This was partially offset by receipts of £55.8m in government subsidy in relation to our rural network in Northern 
          Ireland and Cumbria. 

          This growth was funded through a combination of further shareholder funding of £15m and £61.3m in senior debt. 
          During the year we agreed a £100m extension of our senior debt with existing lenders to fully fund our remaining 
          build programme. 

          Financial key performance indicators 

          The directors consider the following measures to be important indicators of the underlying performance of the 
          business: 

                                                                                                2025          2024

           Fibrus Limited 

           Directors' report 
           For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           The directors present their report and the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025. 

           Directors' responsibilities statement 

           The directors are responsible for preparing the Group strategic report, the Directors' report and the consolidated 
           financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 

           Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
           directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
           Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting 
           Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland'. Under company law 
           the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
           the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 

           In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: 

           ·     select suitable accounting policies for the Group's financial statements and then apply them consistently; 
           ·     make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
           ·     state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
                 disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
                 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
                 Group will continue in business. 

           The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
           Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
           and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
           They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
           reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 

           Results and dividends 

           The loss for the year, after taxation, amounted to £57,356,608 (2024 - loss £53,329,000). 

           The directors have not recommended a dividend (2024: {Nil).

           The directors who served during the year were:

          Engagement with employees 

          During the period, the policy of providing employees with information about the Group has been continued 
          through internal media methods in which employees have also been encouraged to present their suggestions and 
          views on the Group performance. Regular meetings are held between local management and employees to allow a 
          free flow of information and ideas. 

          Disabled employees 

          The Group gives full consideration to applications from all disabled persons where the requirements of the job can 
          be adequately fulfilled by a disabled person. Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group's policy 
          wherever practicable to provide continuing employment under normal terms and conditions and to provide training 
          and career development and promotion to disabled employees wherever appropriate. 

          Human resources 

          The Group's most important resource is its people; their knowledge and experience is crucial to meeting customer 
          requirements. Retention of key staff is critical and the Group have invested increasingly in employment training and

          .     so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company and the Group's

          ·     the director has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a director in order to be aware of any 
                relevant audit information and to establish that the Company and the Group's auditor is aware of that 
                information.

          Independent auditor's report to the members of Fibrus 
          Limited 

          Opinion 

          We have audited the financial statements of Fibrus Limited (the 'parent Company') and its subsidiaries (the 'Group'), 
          which comprise the Consolidated Statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated and Company Balance 
          sheets, the Consolidated Statement of cash flows, the Consolidated and Company Statement of changes in equity 
          for the financial year ended 31 March 2025, and the related notes to the financial statements, including a summary 
          of significant accounting policies. 

          The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
          Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in 
          the UK and Republic of Ireland' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 

          In our opinion, Fibrus Limited's financial statements: 

          ·     give a true and fair view in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice of the 
                assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group's and the Company as at 31 March 2025 and of the 
                Group financial performance and cash flows for the financial year then ended; and 
                 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 

          Basis for opinion 

          We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable 
          law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Responsibilities of the auditor for the 
          audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group and    Company in 
          accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the United 
          Kingdom, namely the FRC's Ethical Standard and the ethical pronouncements established by Chartered 
          Accountants Ireland, applied as determined to be appropriate in the circumstances of the entity. We have fulfilled 
          our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
          obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

          Conclusions relating to going concern 

          In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of 
          accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. 

          Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or 
          conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the parent Company's 
          ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial 
          statements are authorised for issue. 

          Our responsibilities, and the responsibilities of the directors, with respect to going concern are described in the 
          relevant sections of this report. 

                                                                                                                  Page 7

          Independent auditor's report to the members of Fibrus 

          Limited (continued) 

          Other information 

          Other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements 
          and our Auditor's report thereon, including the Directors' report and the Strategic Report. The directors are 
          responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the information and, 
          except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion 
          thereon. 

          In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
          doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
          knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material 
          inconsistencies in the financial statements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in 
          the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
          performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report 
          that fact. 

          We have nothing to report in this regard. 

          Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 

          In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
          .   the information given in the Directors' report and the Strategic Report for the financial year for which the 
              financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements, and 
              the Directors' report and the Strategic Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
              requirements. 

          Matters on which we are required to report by exception 

          In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment we have obtained in the 
          course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Directors' report and the Strategic Report. 

          We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires 
          us to report to you if, in our opinion: 

                 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit 
                have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
          ·      the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
          ·      certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
          .      we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 

                                                                                                                  Page 8

          Independent auditor's report to the members of Fibrus 

          Limited (continued) 

           Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial 
           statements 

          Management is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements which give a true and fair view in 
          accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including FRS102 and for such internal 
          control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
          material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

          In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group and Company's ability to 
          continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
          basis of accounting unless management either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations, 
          or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 

          Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group and Company's financial reporting 
          process. 

          Responsibilities of the auditor for the audit of the financial statements 

          The objectives of an auditor are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
          are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor's report that includes 
          their opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
          accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
           fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
          influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 

          A further description of an auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the 
          Financial Reporting Council's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our 
          auditor's report. 

           Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
          Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in 
          line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including 
           fraud. Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that material misstatement in the 
           financial statements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance 
           with ISAs (UK). 

           The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below: 

          Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance 
           with laws and regulations related to Data Privacy laws, Employment Laws and Health and Safety Laws, and we 
           considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also 
           considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such 
           as Companies Act 2006 and applicable tax laws. The Audit engagement partner considered the experience and 
           expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had appropriate competence and capabilities to identify or 
           recognise non-compliance with the laws and regulation. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities 
           for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined 
           that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate financial performance and 
           management bias through judgements and assumptions in significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation 
           to significant one-off or unusual transactions. 
                                                                                                                     Page 9

          Independent auditor's report to the members of Fibrus 
          Limited (continued) 

          We apply professional scepticism through the audit to consider potential deliberate omission or concealment of 
          significant transactions, or incomplete/inaccurate disclosures in the financial statements. 

          In response to these principal risks, our audit procedures included but were not limited to: 
               inquiries of management on the policies and procedures in place regarding compliance with laws and 
              regulations, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance and whether they have 
              knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; 
               inspection of the Company's regulatory and legal correspondence and review of minutes of the board of 
              directors meetings during the year to corroborate inquiries made; 
           ·   gaining an understanding of the internal controls established to mitigate risk related to fraud; 
               discussion amongst the engagement team in relation to the identified laws and regulations and regarding the risk 
              of fraud, and remaining alert to any indications of non-compliance or opportunities for fraudulent manipulation 
              of financial statements throughout the audit; 
           ·   identifying and testing journal entries to address the risk of inappropriate journals and management override of 
              controls; 
           · designing audit procedures to incorporate unpredictability around the nature, timing or extent of our testing; 
           · challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, 
              including estimating the useful lives of depreciable assets, estimating allowance for the impairment of intangible 
              and tangible assets, and estimating allowance for the impairment of debtors and stocks; and 
           ·   review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation and inquiries of 
              management. 

          The primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of irregularities including fraud rests with those charged 
          with governance and management. As with any audit, there remains a risk of non-detection or irregularities, as these 
          may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or override of internal controls. 

          The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities 

          This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
          Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those 
          matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
          permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's 
          members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

          Fibrus Limited 

          Notes to the financial statements 
          For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           1.   General information 

                 Fibrus Ltd is a private company limited by shares and incorporated in Northern Ireland. The registered office 
                 is 108-113 Dargan Crescent, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT3 9JP. 

                 The principal activity of the Company was a holding company. 
          2.    Accounting policies 

                 2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements 

                     The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise 
                     specified within these accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the 
                     Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 
                     2006. 

                     The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical 
                     accounting estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Group's 
                     accounting policies (see note 3). 

                     The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 
                     2006 and has not presented its own Statement of comprehensive income in these financial statements. 

                     The following principal accounting policies have been applied: 

                2.2 Basis of consolidation 

                     The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its own subsidiaries ("the 
                     Group") as if they form a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group 
                     companies are therefore eliminated in full. 

                     The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the 
                     purchase method. In the Balance sheet, the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
                     liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired 
                     operations are included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on 
                     which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases. 

                                                                                                                 Page 20

          Notes to the financial statements 
          For the year ended 31 March 2025 

          2.     Accounting policies (continued) 

                 2.3 Going concern 

                     The Group has incurred a loss for the financial year of £57,356,608 (2024: {53,329,000); and 
                     had net liabilities of £62,024,725 (2024: {4,668,117) at the balance sheet date. 

                     The Group is primarily focused on its rapidly growing broadband business for its future prosperity and 
                     is actively engaged in accelerating the roll out across Northern Ireland. This will result in a significant 
                     increase in turnover and EBITDA in future years. During the year, the Group was primarily funded 
                     by its senior debt facility and from funding from its primary investor. 

                     For this reason, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which presumes 
                     the realisation of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. The year under review has seen 
                     significant growth as the Group progresses in its goal to bring meaningful connectivity to rural and 
                     regional communities. The Group was previously able to secure £220m with an additional £100m 
                     secured in August 2024 from a consortium of bank to fund the continued expansion of the network 
                     and has drawndown £242.3m as of year ended March 31, 2025. In November 2020, the Group was 
                     successful in bidding for Project Stratum under which it will receive £165m in order to bring 
                     connectivity to 76,000 premises across Northern Ireland and, in January 2022, an additional £32m was 
                     awarded to bring a further 8,500 harder to reach premises into scope of the project. In November 2022, 
                     the Group was successful in bidding for Project Daffodil under which it will receive £108m in order to 
                     bring connectivity to 32,000 premises in Cumbria and in March 2025, an additional £50m was awarded 
                     to bring a further 21,000 premises into the scope of the project. By 31 March 2025, the group had 
                     passed over 425,000 premises across its portfolio of projects. The Group is in a period of rapid 
                     growth, investing in network expansion and customer acquisition, as such it made an operating loss of 
                     £34m for the year while it invested over {107m in building its hyperfast broadband network.

           Notes to the financial statements 
           For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           2.    Accounting policies (continued) 

                 2.4 Foreign currency translation 

                      Functional and presentation currency 

                      The Company's functional and presentational currency is GBP. 

                      Transactions and balances 

                      Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rates at 
                      the dates of the transactions. 

                      At each period end foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Non-monetary 
                      items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and 
                      non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value was 
                      determined. 

                      Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the translation 
                      at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
                      recognised in profit or loss except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash 
                      flow hedges. 

                      Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented 
                      in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income within 'finance income or costs'. All other 
                      foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in profit or loss within 'other operating income'. 

                      On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into Sterling at rates approximating 
                      to those ruling when the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are 
                      translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening 
                      net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other 
                      comprehensive income. 

                 2.5 Turnover 

                      Turnover is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service. A customer obtains 
                      control when it has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the good or 
                      service. Turnover from the provision of telecommunications services with respect to broadband and 
                      other add on services are recognised when the service is rendered. Turnover is stated net of 
                      discount and value added taxes. 

                 2.6 Operating leases: the Group as lessee 

                      Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease 
                      term. 

                      Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are recognised on a straight- 
                      line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the 
                      lessee's benefit from the use of the leased asset. 

                                                                                                                   Page 22

          Notes to the financial statements 
          For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           2.    Accounting policies (continued) 

                 2.7 Research and development 

                      In the research phase of an internal project it is not possible to demonstrate that the project will 
                      generate future economic benefits and hence all expenditure on research shall be recognised as an 
                      expense when it is incurred. Intangible assets are recognised from the development phase of a project if 
                      and only if certain specific criteria are met in order to demonstrate the asset will generate probable 
                      future economic benefits and that its cost can be reliably measured. The capitalised development costs 
                      are subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, which range from 3 
                      to 6 years. 

                      If it is not possible to distinguish between the research phase and the development phase of an internal 
                      project, the expenditure is treated as if it were all incurred in the research phase only. 

                 2.8 Government grants 

                      Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102. Grants relating to expenditure 
                      on tangible fixed assets are credited to profit or loss at the same rate as the depreciation on the assets to 
                      which the grant relates. The deferred element of grants is included in creditors as deferred income. 

                      Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 
                      the same period as the related expenditure. 

                 2.9 Interest income 

                      Interest income is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. 

                 2.10 Finance costs 

                      Finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the term of the debt using the effective interest method 
                      so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are initially 
                      recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument. 

                 2.11 Borrowing costs 

                      All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred. 

                 2.12 Pensions 

                      Defined contribution pension plan 

                      The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a 
                      pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the 
                      contributions have been paid the Group has no further payment obligations. 

                      The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid 
                      are shown in accruals as a liability in the Balance sheet. The assets of the plan are held separately from 
                      the Group in independently administered funds. 

                                                                                                                    Page 23

           For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           2.    Accounting policies (continued) 

                 2.13 Current and deferred taxation 

                      The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss 
                      except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other comprehensive 
                      income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or 
                      directly in equity respectively. 

                      The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
                      substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company and the Group 
                      operate and generate income. 

                      Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not 
                      reversed by the balance sheet date, except that: 
                      ·     The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be 
                            recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits; 
                            Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax 
                            allowances have been met; and 
                      ·     Where they relate to timing differences in respect of interests in subsidiaries, associates, branches 
                            and joint ventures and the Group can control the reversal of the timing differences and such 
                            reversal is not considered probable in the foreseeable future. 

                      Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of 
                      business combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of 
                      assets acquired and the future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair 
                      values of liabilities acquired and the amount that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined 
                      using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 

                 2.14 Exceptional items 

                      Exceptional items are transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group but are presented 
                      separately due to their size or incidence. 

                                                                                                                   Page 24

           Notes to the financial statements 
           For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           2.    Accounting policies (continued) 

                 2.15 Intangible assets 

                      Goodwill 

                      Goodwill represents the difference between amounts paid on the cost of a business combination and 
                      the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the Group's share of its identifiable assets and liabilities of the 
                      acquiree at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
                      accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line 
                      basis to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income over its useful economic life. 

                      Other intangible assets 

                      Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible 
                      assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 

                      All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life 
                      cannot be made, the useful life shall not exceed ten years. 

                       The estimated useful lives range as follows: 

                             Software development              -       5    years straight line 
                             Licenses                          -      20    years straight line 

                 2.16 Tangible fixed assets 

                      Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and 
                      any accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to 
                      bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 
                      intended by management. 

                      Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated 
                      useful lives, using the straight-line method. 

                      Depreciation is provided on the following basis: 

                             Network assets                   - 7 - 15 years 
                             Plant and machinery              - 15 years 
                             Motor vehicles                   - 3 - 5 years 
                             Office equipment                 - 5 years 
                             Assets under construction        - Nil 

                      The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted 
                      prospectively if appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting 
                      date. 

                      Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and 
                      are recognised in profit or loss. 

                                                                                                                      Page 25

          Notes to the financial statements 
           For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           2.    Accounting policies (continued) 

                 2.17 Impairment of assets 

                      At each reporting date fixed assets are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication that those 
                      assets have suffered an impairment loss. If there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable 
                      amount of any affected asset is estimated and compared with its carrying amount. If estimated 
                      recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is reduced to its estimated recoverable amount, and an 
                      impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 

                      If an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carry amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
                      estimate of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the amount that would have been determined 
                      had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
                      recognised immediately in profit or loss. 

                 2.18 Valuation of investments 

                     Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment. 

                 2.19 Stocks 

                      Stocks comprise mainly of items concerned with the build of network and connection of customers. 
                      Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase and 
                      other costs incurred in bringing the stocks to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is 
                      the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. 

                      At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stock is impaired, the carrying amount is 
                      reduced to its selling price less costs to complete and sell. The impairment loss is recognised 
                      immediately in administrative expenses in the Consolidated statement of profit and loss. 

                 2.20 Debtors 

                      Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are 
                      measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost 
                      using the effective interest method, less any impairment. 

                 2.21 Customer acquisition costs 

                      The sales costs directly attributable to acquiring new customers are amortised over the estimated average 
                      tenure of a customer. 

                 2.22 Cash and cash equivalents 

                      Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on 
                      notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more 
                      than three months from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of 
                      cash with insignificant risk of change in value. 

                      In the Consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank 
                      overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management. 

                                                                                                                   Page 26

                       Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank 
                       loans, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at

                       Provisions are recognised when an event has taken place that gives rise to a legal or constructive 
                       obligation, a transfer of economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made. 

                       Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation, taking into 
                       account the related risks and uncertainties. 

                       Increases in provisions are generally charged as an expense to profit or loss. 

                  2.25 Financial instruments 

                       The Group only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of 
                       financial assets and liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other 
                       third parties, loans to related parties and investments in ordinary shares. 

                       Debt instruments (other than those wholly repayable or receivable within one year), including loans and 
                       other accounts receivable and payable, are initially measured at present value of the future cash flows 
                       and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are 
                       payable or receivable within one year, typically trade debtors and creditors, are measured, initially and 
                       subsequently, at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid or 
                       received. However, if the arrangements of a short-term instrument constitute a financing transaction, 
                       like the payment of a trade debt deferred beyond normal business terms or in case of an out-right short- 
                       term loan that is not at market rate, the financial asset or liability is measured, initially at the present 
                       value of future cash flows discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument and 
                       subsequently at amortised cost, unless it qualifies as a loan from a director in the case of a small 
                       company, or a public benefit entity concessionary loan. 

                       Investments in non-derivative instruments that are equity to the issuer are measured: 
                           at fair value with changes recognised in the Consolidated profit and loss account if the shares are 
                           publicly traded or their fair value can otherwise be measured reliably; 
                       ·   at cost less impairment for all other investments. 

                       Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting 
                       period for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an 
                       impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated profit and loss account. 

                       For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference 
                       between an asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the 
                       asset's original effective interest rate. If a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for 
                       measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. 

                       For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the difference 
                       between an asset's carrying amount and best estimate of the recoverable amount, which is an 
                       approximation of the amount that the Group would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the 
                       balance sheet date. 
                                                                                                                        Page 27

           Notes to the financial statements 
           For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           2.    Accounting policies (continued) 

                 2.25 Financial instruments (continued) 

                      Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance sheet when there is 
                      an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis 
                      or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 

                      Derivatives, including interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, are not basic financial 
                      instruments. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered 
                      into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are 
                      recognised in profit or loss in finance costs or income as appropriate. The Group does not currently 
                      apply hedge accounting for interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives. 

                 2.26 Hedge accounting 

                      The Group uses variable to fixed interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fair value risk on its enter 
                      user text. These derivatives are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. 

                      To the extent the cash flow hedge is effective, movements in fair value are recognised in other 
                      comprehensive income and presented in a separate cash flow hedge reserve. Any ineffective portions of 
                      those movements are recognised in profit or loss for the year. 

                      Gains and losses on the hedging instruments and the hedged items are recognised in profit or loss for 
                      the year. When a hedged item is an unrecognised firm commitment, the cumulative hedging gain or loss 
                      on the hedged item is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in 
                      profit or loss. 

                                                                                                                    Page 28

          Notes to the financial statements 
          For the year ended 31 March 2025 
          3.    Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty 

                The preparation of the non-statutory financial statements requires management to make judgements, 
                estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying 
                notes. The judgements, estimates and assumptions used in the financial statements are based upon 
                management's evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements. 

                Actual results could differ from these estimates, and the effect of any change in estimates will be adjusted in 
                the financial statements when they become reasonably determinable. 

                Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and 
                other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under these 
                circumstances. 

                Judgements 
                In the process of applying the Group and Company's accounting policies, management has made the 
                following judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the 
                amounts recognised in the non-statutory financial statements: 

                 Going concern 
                As described in the basis of preparation and going concern in Note 2.3 above, the validity of the going 
                concern basis is dependent upon the Group's continued growth and roll out of its hyperfast fibre broadband. 
                After making enquiries and considering the matters referred to in Note 2.3, the directors have a reasonable 
                expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
                foreseeable future. For these reasons the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
                in preparing the financial statements. 

          4.     Turnover 

                An analysis of turnover by class of business is as follows: 

                                                                                                   2025          2024 
                                                                                                                     £ 
                Sales                                                                        29,498,984     17,583,861 
                                                                                             29,498,984     17,583,861 

                All amounts relate to the Group's principal activities and are generated in the United Kingdom. 

                                                                                                                 Page 29

          Notes to the financial statements 
          For the year ended 31 March 2025 

           12.   Taxation (continued) 

                Factors affecting tax charge for the year 

                The tax assessed for the year is lower than (2024 - higher than) the standard rate of corporation tax in the 
                 UK of 25% (2024 - 25%). The differences are explained below: 

                                                                                                   2025          2024 
                                                                                                      £             £ 

                Loss on ordinary activities before tax                                      (57,578,878)   (53,447,547) 

                Loss on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in 
                  the UK of 25% (2024 - 25%)                                                (14,394,720)   (13,361,887)

                Factors that may affect future tax charges 

                 A net deferred tax asset of £25,572,290 (2024: {15,716,503) has not been recognised as, in the opinion of the 
                 directors, there is sufficient uncertainty that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future 
                reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.

                Exceptional costs relate to costs incurred as part of the Group restructuring in light of the significant build 
                 contracts won and the Group's overall growth plans, as well as once off costs incurred on such contracts.
