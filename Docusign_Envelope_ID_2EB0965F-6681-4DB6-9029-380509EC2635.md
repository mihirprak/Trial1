# Group strategic report

For the year ended 31 March 2025

## Introduction

The directors have pleasure in presenting the strategic report for the year ended 31 March 2025.

## Principal activity and strategy

Fibrus' principal activity is the deployment of new full fibre broadband infrastructure to homes and businesses across Northern Ireland and parts of the North of England.

Our strategy is to deploy our full fibre infrastructure to regional and rural areas that have been underserved by legacy networks. Fibrus has focused on regional towns and villages with lower fibre coverage. In addition, in both Northern Ireland and Cumbria, Fibrus has won government funding to partly finance the deployment of network to rural premises which would not otherwise be commercially viable, enabling our network to reach deeper into rural areas.

We anticipate that the majority of homes and businesses in the areas that we operate will eventually have access to other fibre networks in the future, so we focus on being first to get to market and proactively acquire the customers based on better value and better service.

## Operating review

Fibrus has established itself as one of the leading independent full fibre operators in the UK and Ireland due to a track record of delivering on build and on customer take-up.

### Build programme delivery

- In March 2025 we delivered the second milestone of our BDUK funded Gigabit project in Cumbria, successfully delivering full fibre connectivity to almost 12,500 homes and businesses in Cumbria — on time and within budget. This was part of a £108 million contract which initially covered 32,000 homes and businesses in Cumbria.
- In March 2025 the UK Government contract was extended, allowing the company to deliver Full Fibre broadband to an additional 21,000 previously underserved premises in Cumbria with the total subsidy increasing to £150 million. Once completed, alongside other commercial expansion plans, 99% of homes and businesses in Cumbria will have access to next-generation broadband.
- In June 2025 we completed the delivery of the 'Stratum' programme which brought full fibre connectivity to 81,148 homes across Northern Ireland. This large scale public infrastructure project was delivered on time and on budget and has transformed access to high speed connectivity in rural areas and delivered significant economic benefits to the local economy.

An independently produced Economic Impact Report assessed that the project had delivered benefits of some £431 million to the local economy since 2020:

- £431 million in total economic value generated since 2020
- £74 million from company operations including turnover, wages, and job creation
- £271 million through supply chain investment
- £86 million from indirect spending by Fibrus employees across the local economy
- 435 people employed by Fibrus
- £50.6 million in potential annual productivity gains per year from full fibre broadband access
- Over 411K charitable contributions across Northern Ireland

Northern Ireland now boasts 94% connectivity, outpacing other UK nations and regions. As a result, the region has become a trailblazer in digital connectivity, helping to futureproof its workforce by enabling access to remote and hybrid job opportunities across the UK and beyond.

# Group strategic report (continued)

## Rapid customer take-up

Fibrus has delivered accelerated take-up across its footprint through its focus on product performance, best value pricing and customer service.

- Connected customers grew by 35k during the year, a growth of 45%, bringing our penetration rate to 27.9% of our ready-for-service homes.
- Customer churn is 5.4% on an annualised basis (over half categorised as uncontrollable).

Key metrics:

- Connected customers (000's): Mar 22: 9.5 → Mar 25: 113.5
- Premises RFS (000's): Mar 22: 113.4 → Mar 25: 407.3
- Penetration: Mar 22: 8.4% → Mar 25: 27.9%

## Principal risks and uncertainties

Key risks: competition, customer take-up, churn, technological advance, economic risk (interest rates/inflation), financial risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk (managed via interest rate swaps).
